Any surprise to come from this with Derrick Henry leading in another graph. This is coming from the graph and no surprise that Henry is still leading again with a big lead of stats against everyone. He is showing why he is the best in the NFL.</p>

After calculating yards per attempt and yards per game, Derrick Henry is still in the lead follow by Dalvin Cook and Nick Chubb. I calculated this and see if they’re any changes and their was not much any at all. Henry is still in the lead among running backs.</p>

Overall, from all of these graphs, Derrick Henry has became the best running back from them and can finally put everything to rest. He has proven to be better than Nick Chubb, Dalvin Cook and Alvin Kamara even. He is proven to be the best running back again from the graphs. I even mix up some of the data to make it more intriguing to see if it changes and it doesn’t really.</p>
